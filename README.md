# Northwoods-League-Baseball-Project
Building a model to predict performance in the Northwoods League based on colligate performance

## Collecting Data:

Since there is no good place to download the data needed to complete this project, step one is building a web-crawler to collect the data.

## Analyzing Data: 

(Currently working on this part)

Once we have all of the data collected, I of couse had to clean it before we can do much with it. Most of the data at this point is 
actually reading in as a string, so I had to make those numeric before I could do anything else as well as drop all of the empty columns.
Next I worked on building models, bootstraping the data, and taking confidence intervals from the boostrapped models since if this data were
collected again, it likley would not be the same.
